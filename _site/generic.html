									<h1>A little about me</h1>

								<p>Hi, I’m Alex, I’m not only a recent graduate of the Georgia State University Computer Science program, but a young,
									curious, optimistic, and open individual who is eager to learn new things, meet new people, take on new challenges, and
									help to build things that can help one person or an entire community. I am just passionate about creating, whether that
									be drawing something or diving into a technology for a Hackathon project, the ability to make something is something
									that I am thankful to have.</p>
								<p>I am a young black man who is passionate about technology and helping others who may be underrepresented in tech get
								into the field. I do this through volunteering and teaching whether it be teaching HTML & CSS classes every week or
								being a mentor for Girls Who Code, I strive to bring knowledge to those who would not normally not have access to it so
								that way they can create opportunities for themselves.</p>
								<p>Some of my hobbies are exercising, learning about other cultures, video games, learning new things, food, helping others
								in tech, and listening to music. I am a very active person who enjoys several forms of exercises and working out,
								whether it be swimming, lifting, yoga, or hiking, I am always in the mood to get moving. I enjoy Korean culture and
								listen to a lot of Korean music amongst other international music. You can find me tweeting at the WRAS's (GSU's student
								run radio station) Korean music show DJ on Friday nights, requesting music or commenting on the playlist. I love
								teaching and volunteering so I teach people HTML& CSS through GSU's CETL (Center for Excellence in Teaching & Learning)
								as well as volunteering as a mentor for Girls Who Code in the past.</p>
